# Week 6 Relfection 

In week 6 assignment we are focusing on how to access and process data from files. The first prompt is to load temperature data from the specific file type and convert the numbers to floating numbers. For the first prompt something that I noticed that was different was the corrected code checks for empty lines first. In my code I used the method .strip() that removes spaces and tabs from the beginning and end of the words in the list. The .strip() method only helps with the data on hand, however checking for empty lines would prevent errors and unnecessary processing of blank lines. I should have checked for empty lines as well. Additionally, we are trying to analyse the temperature data by calculating average,minimum,maxium,and count. In this code I used the python built in functions to calculate the minimum,maximum and the total number of temperatures. To calculate the average I need to manually input the formula.The corrected code starts by initialising variables to set a starting point for the calculations and manually performs the formulas using loops. I feel that the built in functions make the code look more concise but writing the initialization and calculations manually makes it easier to understand what's happening step by step.  The next prompt is applying markup to a text. In this prompt we are creating a function that goes through the list of words in the text file to identify if they have a markup of a (.) or a (_). If a word starts with a (.) it is converted to uppercase, if it starts with (.) it is converted to uppercase. If it starts with a (_) it is printed with spaces between each letter. In this prompt I practiced using built in python functions to help me. For example, I used .upper() to capitalize words and ‘ ‘.join() to add spaces between characters. In the corrected code it manually processes out words instead of using ‘ ‘.join. Furthermore, the corrected code uses nested if functions. In my code I practiced using the elif keyword to check multiple conditions. For both of the prompts I practiced using some of pythons built in methods to help with my code. For the future if I want to better show my work in more depth, I should avoid relying solely on Python's built in methods and write manually by using different approaches to solve the same problem. Furthermore, an error I noticed too late was that my test code wasn’t correctly set up to run the file as it should. I was able to fix my mistake to make sure the file runs and returns the answers using the files given.
